## Description

# T130 — AI-assisted operational project analysis and deploy profile generation

## Objective

Add an AI-assisted deployer workflow able to analyze any managed repository and generate reviewable operational documentation and deployment profiles.

The workflow must use the LLM runtime configured by the daemon/executor environment instead of hardcoding a specific AI provider.

## Included

- Add an “Analyze Project” action to the deployer UI.
- Use deterministic Python project scanning as structured context input.
- Send repository structure + scan result to the configured LLM runtime.
- Generate:
  - `.ai-dev-factory/deploy.yml`
  - `.ai-dev-factory/deployment.md`
  - optional `.ai-dev-factory/runtime-notes.md`
- Infer:
  - required tools
  - docker services
  - host-side processes
  - build commands
  - startup commands
  - restart commands
  - healthchecks
  - runtime dependencies
  - environment variables
  - known operational constraints
- Commit generated operational files to a dedicated branch.
- Create or update a PR for human review.
- Show analysis progress, logs and failures in the dashboard.
- Add tests for:
  - prompt generation
  - AI execution orchestration
  - file generation
  - Git branch workflow
  - PR creation/update

## Excluded

- Automatic deployment execution.
- Automatic install of missing dependencies.
- Automatic merge.
- Secrets management.
- Remote/cloud deployment orchestration.

## Acceptance criteria

- A user can trigger repository operational analysis from the dashboard.
- The configured LLM runtime analyzes the repository and generates reviewable operational files.
- Generated deploy.yml is valid and compatible with the deployer runtime.
- Generated documentation explains how to build/start/restart/check the project.
- Generated files are committed to a dedicated branch.
- A PR is created or updated automatically.
- Existing deployer/runtime workflows remain functional.
