# Plan review — T201 ready_to_take rule alignment

The T201 plan is broadly aligned with the issue goal: it introduces a project-level Execution Rules Engine, stores project rules and ticket evaluations, exposes API/UI, and keeps scheduler/worker execution unchanged.

However, one blocking consistency issue must be fixed before implementation starts.

## Blocking issue — `require_human_approval` depends on an approval-table implementation detail

The current plan defines:

```text
require_human_approval
→ reads latest ticket_approvals.approval_status == approved for type execution
```

This is too tightly coupled to the internal implementation of T199.

T199 introduced the user-facing lifecycle concept:

```text
ready_candidate
↓
human approval
↓
ready_to_take
```

For the Rules Engine, the policy should not care whether `ready_to_take` was produced from:

- an approval table row
- a readiness row
- a future helper
- a future policy engine

The rule should evaluate the canonical execution eligibility state, not an internal table detail.

## Required behavior

Change the rule to:

```text
require_human_approval
→ passes when the ticket is ready_to_take
```

Preferred implementation:

```text
compute_execution_eligibility(db_path, ticket_id) == "ready_to_take"
```

or an equivalent T199 helper / canonical API-level state if available.

If no helper exists, introduce a small wrapper inside the rules engine:

```text
get_execution_approval_state(db_path, ticket_id) -> str
```

that abstracts over the underlying T199 tables.

The rule should not directly inspect `ticket_approvals.approval_status == approved` unless that is hidden behind the helper.

## Minor clarification — default policy count

The plan says:

```text
Default project policy: all four require_* rules enabled; thresholds disabled.
```

But the visible rule list contains:

```text
require_readiness_candidate
require_human_approval
require_ticket_intelligence
block_when_human_review_required
max_estimated_cost_usd
max_difficulty
```

Only three names start with `require_*`, plus `block_when_human_review_required`.

Clarify the default policy explicitly, for example:

```text
Default policy enables:
- require_ticket_intelligence
- require_readiness_candidate
- require_human_approval
- block_when_human_review_required

Default policy disables threshold rules:
- max_estimated_cost_usd
- max_difficulty
```

## Required correction

Update `runs/T201/plan.md` so that:

1. `require_human_approval` is based on canonical `ready_to_take` execution eligibility.
2. Direct approval-table inspection is hidden behind a helper if needed.
3. The default policy list is explicit and unambiguous.
4. Tests verify `require_human_approval` using `ready_to_take`, not by asserting an internal approval table value.

## Review verdict

PLAN_FIX_REQUIRED until the human approval rule is aligned with T199's `ready_to_take` lifecycle abstraction.
