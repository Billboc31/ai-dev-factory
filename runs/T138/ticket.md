# T138 — T138 — Generic AI sandbox auto-fix loop

**Source**: GitHub Issue #124

## Description

# Objective

Add a generic AI-driven sandbox auto-fix loop able to analyze sandbox deployment failures, modify operational artifacts, rerun validation, and converge toward a successful runtime state.

The implementation must remain generic and must NOT contain ai-dev-factory-specific deployment assumptions.

## Context

T134 introduced sandbox deploy validation.

T137 introduces:
- isolated sandbox ports
- sandbox env files
- compose project isolation
- sandbox lifecycle management
- historical sandbox runs

The next step is an automated correction loop:

sandbox validation fails
→ logs captured
→ AI analyzes failure
→ AI modifies scripts/config
→ sandbox reruns
→ repeat until success or retry limit

## Included

### Generic auto-fix orchestration

- Add a sandbox auto-fix orchestrator.
- Retry loop must be bounded with configurable max retries.
- Each iteration must:
  - capture sandbox state
  - capture logs
  - capture operational scripts
  - call the configured AI runtime
  - apply modifications
  - rerun sandbox validation

### Generic project support

The loop must NOT assume:
- ai-dev-factory project structure
- api/web services
- fixed ports
- docker-only projects
- specific frameworks

The loop must rely on:
- deploy.yml
- sandbox state
- generated operational scripts
- runtime logs
- component definitions
- deploy metadata

### AI fix payload

Provide the AI runtime with:
- deploy profile
- sandbox state
- logs
- failing step
- operational scripts
- relevant runtime metadata

### Safe file modification

- Restrict modifications to allowed operational files.
- Track changed files per iteration.
- Persist iteration history.
- Never modify unrelated runtime state.

### Sandbox rerun

- After fixes are applied:
  - rerun validation
  - capture new logs/state
  - compare iterations

### Dashboard UI

Add auto-fix visibility:
- current iteration
- max retries
- iteration status
- changed files
- logs per iteration
- final outcome

### Failure handling

Handle safely:
- invalid AI output
- malformed patches
- repeated failures
- infinite retry risks
- sandbox crashes
- supervisor disconnects

### Tests

Add tests for:
- successful convergence after fix
- retry limit reached
- malformed AI output
- patch application failure
- generic deploy.yml handling
- iteration history persistence

## Excluded

- automatic merge to main
- production deployment
- cloud deployment
- tester-agent business tests
- self-modifying core runtime outside allowed sandbox artifacts

## Acceptance criteria

- sandbox failures can trigger a generic AI correction loop
- the loop works without ai-dev-factory-specific assumptions
- retries are bounded and observable
- iteration history is persisted and visible
- sandbox reruns after fixes
- malformed AI output is safely rejected
- the system never enters infinite retry loops
- successful fixes result in sandbox success state
- failed retries result in clean terminal failed state
