# Generic Planner Task Read the ticket below and produce a detailed implementation plan. 

## Required output structure (strict) Your reply **MUST** be a Markdown document containing **exactly** these four level-2 headings, in this order, spelled exactly as shown:
## Objective
## Included
## Excluded
## Acceptance criteria
These headings are mandatory even for trivial tickets. A short plan is acceptable — an unstructured plan is not. - ## Objective — one or two sentences describing what the change achieves. - ## Included — concrete changes (files, functions, logic, tests). - ## Excluded — what is explicitly out of scope for this ticket. - ## Acceptance criteria — verifiable conditions a reviewer can check. ## Invalid output Your reply is **invalid** if any of the four headings above is missing, renamed, mistyped, or replaced by a synonym (e.g. ## Goal, ## Scope, ## In scope, ## Out of scope, ## Plan, ## Tasks are **not** accepted). An invalid reply will be rejected by the automated validator and the ticket will be retried. You **MUST NOT** write: - "implementation done" - "changes applied" - "here is what was done" - any past-tense report of work already performed You produce a *future* plan, not a status report. ## Minimal valid example (for a trivial ticket)
markdown
## Objective
Rename the helper `foo()` to `bar()` in `utils.py` to align with the new
naming convention. Behaviour is preserved.

## Included
- `utils.py`: rename `foo` → `bar`, update the docstring.
- `tests/test_utils.py`: update the single import and assertion.

## Excluded
- Renaming callers in other modules (tracked in a follow-up ticket).
- Any logic change inside `foo` / `bar`.

## Acceptance criteria
- `utils.py` no longer defines `foo`.
- `pytest tests/test_utils.py` passes.
- No other file references the old name.
